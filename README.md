php-lifestream
==============

Uses the Google social graph API to find profiles for a given URL (using rel=me) and generate a stream of events from feeds connected to that profile.

It's an interesting way to explore the online activity of someone with strong semanticly connected profiles.

State of the code
=================

I made this demo quite a few years ago, since then some of the services used have been deprecated, moved or otherwise changed. As such bits of this probablhy won't work anymore, which is a shame, because it was kind of awesome.

The code in this repo is not in a working/tested state and was extracted out the main repo for my website, for prosperity.
